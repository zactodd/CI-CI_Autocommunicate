# CI-CI_Autocommunicate
Short term goal enable the communication between GitHub and DropBox so that DropBox can act as the storage system and 
as a kind of a terminal where the DropBox git commits will be added to a periodic GitHub pull request on the GitHub store 
repository. Somewhat circumventing the the limitations GitHub free tier uses private repository contribute limit.
